Purpose of work: study of the hyperparameters of the neural network, understanding impact of different hyperparameters on accuracy.

There are 2 parts of work in files named Lab1-Part1 and Lab1-Part2 respectively. Both parts represent work with collections of training and test data. Part 1 represent recognition of basic math functions with illustrations of neural net vision of the functions for training. Part 2 represent recognition of simple images for making following work. Data usage represented at https://keras.io/datasets/ and depends on variant.

There are represented such hyperparameters as

Layer count
Neurons count per layer (actually it’s not hyperparameter but structure parameter)
Learn rate
Regularization L1 and L2
Output layer activation type
Layer activation type
Loss function type
Epoch count
By changing these hyperparameters try to reach max accuracy value(at least 0.95) for Part2 model with fixed epoch count 20
Change 1st hyperparameter’s value from min to max with minimal step depends on your variant
Show impact on result using graphs
Describe impact of each hyperparameter on accuracy.
Set hyperparameter value back to one which produced max accuracy
Repeat 2-5 steps for second hyperparameter
